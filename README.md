This is a TO-Do-List application to register your desired task you want to do along the days!
It's not a complete app but a good point to start to develop more features in future!

There is a text field you can write the task you want. by clicking on the (+write a task) the value within text field will be transfered to the task section along with two buttons: a done button and a delete button

Everything isworking properly but if you want to click done button or delete button, the first click doesn't work but the second one works! So, I need to find out how to solve this issue!

The next thing is setting an reminder to this. For example, you want to add "going out for shopping at 7:00 pm", so this app should remind you on the time you already determine for it!
